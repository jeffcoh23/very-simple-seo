    <<~PROMPT
      You are an expert SEO content researcher. Perform comprehensive web research on "#{@keyword}" and gather ALL of the following elements:

      ## 1. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES & CASE STUDIES

      - title: Clear table title
      - headers: Column names (array)

      For videos: Prefer tutorials over marketing videos.
      For images: Ignore stock photos, headshots, logos.

      ## 8. DOWNLOADABLE RESOURCES
