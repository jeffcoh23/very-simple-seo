# VerySimpleSEO - Product Plan

## The Core Problem
Solopreneurs and indie hackers know they should do SEO, but:
- Keyword research is overwhelming (too many tools, too expensive)
- Writing SEO content takes forever
- They're not sure if they're targeting the right keywords
- They just want to ship content and rank, not become SEO experts

## The Solution Flow

### 1. **Get Started (5 minutes)**
- Sign up with email
- Create your first project (e.g., "My SaaS Landing Page")
- Enter your website URL (e.g., signallab.app)
- We automatically find 3-5 competitors OR you can add your own
- Hit "Research Keywords"

### 2. **See Your Opportunities (Instant)**
You land on a dashboard showing:
- **30 keyword opportunities** ranked by "how easy to win"
- Each keyword shows:
  - Search volume (how many people search this)
  - Difficulty score (how hard to rank)
  - Opportunity score (our recommendation)
  - Why it matters (commercial intent, informational, etc.)
- Sorted by opportunity score (best ones first)
- Visual indicators: ðŸŸ¢ Easy wins, ðŸŸ¡ Medium effort, ðŸ”´ Hard

### 3. **Pick a Keyword & Generate**
- Click "Write Article" on any keyword
- We show you:
  - What's currently ranking (top 10 results)
  - Common topics they cover
  - Gaps you can exploit
- Confirm or tweak the approach
- Hit "Generate Article" (takes 2-3 minutes)

### 4. **Review & Export**
- See the full article with:
  - SEO-optimized title & meta description
  - Complete outline with sections
  - Written content in your style (if you provide sample writing)
  - Placeholders for screenshots/tools you might add
- Light editing tools (fix typos, adjust tone)
- Export options:
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Download as Markdown
  - Download as HTML

### 5. **Track Progress**
- Mark keywords as "Published" when you use them
- See which keywords you've covered vs. opportunities remaining

## Key Screens

1. **Projects Dashboard** - List of your websites
2. **Project Overview** - One project, showing keyword opportunities
3. **Keyword Detail** - Deep dive on one keyword before writing
4. **Article Generator** - Loading screen while we research & write
5. **Article Editor** - Review/edit the generated article
6. **Published Articles** - Track what you've shipped

## What Makes This Different

**For the user:**
- No analysis paralysis - we tell you exactly what to write
- One click from keyword â†’ full article
- Affordable (under $50/month or one-time purchase)
- Works for any niche (SaaS, blogs, local businesses)

**Under the hood (not visible to user):**
- Real SERP research (we actually fetch top articles)
- Extracts real examples and stats from competitors
- Uses your writing voice if you provide samples
- Focuses on winnable keywords (not impossible ones)
