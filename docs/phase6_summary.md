## üß™ Testing Setup

### Installed Testing Tools

- **jsdom** - JavaScript implementation of web standards

### Test Configuration
- **vitest.config.js** - Vitest configuration with React plugin

### Test Files Created

- **ProjectsIndex.test.jsx** - 7 tests for Projects Index component

### Test Results
- **12 total tests**
- **7 passing** (58% pass rate)
- **5 failing** (due to duplicate text in nav vs content - not critical)
