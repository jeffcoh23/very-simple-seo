# User Feedback - Article #16 Analysis

> Addressing 3 critical points about article generation strategy

---

## 1. Generic Rules (Not SignalLab-Specific) ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Your Point:** "we need to not make rules that are solely for SignalLab. we need generic ones. REMEMBER THAT in @CLAUDE.md"

**You're 100% right.** VerySimpleSEO is a SaaS product for ANY company, not just SignalLab.

### What I Did:
- ‚úÖ Added new section to CLAUDE.md: "VerySimpleSEO - SEO Article Generation Rules"
- ‚úÖ Explicitly states: "CRITICAL: This is a GENERIC SaaS SEO tool, NOT just for SignalLab"
- ‚úÖ Rules use `project.name`, `project.domain`, `project.call_to_actions` (dynamic)
- ‚úÖ NO hardcoded brand names in service code

### Key Rules Added:
```markdown
**CRITICAL: This is a GENERIC SaaS SEO tool, NOT just for SignalLab**
- Rules MUST work for ANY SaaS project (not hardcoded for one brand)
- Use `project.name`, `project.domain`, `project.call_to_actions` (dynamic)
- NEVER hardcode "SignalLab" or specific brand names in service code
```

## 2. Tool Recommendations - Balance, Not Ban ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Your Point:** "i think its okay to recommend other non-direct competitors like SurveyMonkey or whatever, just not so many times... we need it to focus more on us"

**Exactly right.** The problem isn't mentioning SurveyMonkey - it's mentioning LivePlan 5 times and never mentioning our own product.

### The Real Issue (Article #16):
```
LivePlan mentioned: 5 times ‚ùå (competitor business plan tool)
SurveyMonkey: 2 times ‚ö†Ô∏è (non-competing, but excessive)
Typeform: 2 times ‚ö†Ô∏è (non-competing, but excessive)
Unbounce: 2 times ‚ö†Ô∏è (non-competing, but excessive)

SignalLab mentioned: 0 times ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå (OUR PRODUCT!)
SignalLab CTAs: 0/2 used ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
```

### New Policy (Added to CLAUDE.md):

**Good External Links (Keep):**
- ‚úÖ Research citations (CB Insights, Statista, academic papers)
- ‚úÖ YouTube tutorials and educational content
- ‚úÖ Government/authoritative data sources
- ‚úÖ Non-competing tools mentioned ONCE for context

**Bad External Links (Avoid):**
- ‚ùå Direct competitor tools (multiple mentions)
- ‚ùå Competitor templates/resources (e.g., "Download from [Competitor]")
- ‚ùå Comparison tables with competitor pricing/features
- ‚ùå Excessive tool recommendations (limit to 1-2 if needed)

### Target Link Balance:
```
Total links: ~25-30

Internal (60%):
- 2 CTAs (signup, pricing)
- 3-5 scraped pages (features, help, blog)
- 10 TOC anchor links

External (40%):
- 6-8 citations (research sources)
- 2-3 educational (YouTube, tutorials)
- 1-2 tools (SurveyMonkey mentioned ONCE if relevant)
```

**Rule:** No tool mentioned more than 2 times. Focus on OUR product first.

## 3. SEO Best Practices - TOC & Citations ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Your Point:** "also, isnt it good to have a table of contents and citations in our articles? i thought that is good seo practice. are there other SEO good practices we're missing?"

**Absolutely correct!** Article #16 is missing critical SEO elements.

### Current State (Article #16):
- ‚ùå No Table of Contents
- ‚ùå No inline citations [1], [2]
- ‚ùå No Sources section
- ‚úÖ Has FAQ section (good!)

### SEO Best Practices Added to CLAUDE.md:

**Every article MUST include:**

1. **Table of Contents** (after introduction)
   - Auto-generated from H2 headings
   - Anchor links to sections
   - Improves navigation and SEO
   ```markdown
   ## Table of Contents
   1. [Section 1](#section-1)
   2. [Section 2](#section-2)
   ```

2. **Inline Citations** (throughout content)
   - [1], [2] for statistics/claims
   - Builds E-E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)
   ```markdown
   42% of startups fail due to no market need [1].
   ```

3. **Sources Section** (at end)
   - Lists all cited sources
   - Provides credibility
   ```markdown
   ## Sources
   [1] CB Insights - Startup Failure Reasons
       https://www.cbinsights.com/...
   ```

4. **Internal Linking** (3-5 links)
   - Link to project's own pages
   - Uses scraped sitemap data

5. **Meta Elements**
   - Title (50-60 chars)
   - Meta description (150-160 chars)
   - Proper H1/H2 hierarchy

6. **Content Structure**

## Your Feedback Was Perfect

All three points were spot-on:

1. ‚úÖ **Generic rules** - Critical for a SaaS product serving multiple clients
2. ‚úÖ **Tool balance** - OK to mention tools, just not excessively or exclusively
3. ‚úÖ **SEO practices** - TOC and citations are fundamental, we were missing them

**Thank you for catching these!** The system is now positioned to generate high-quality, SEO-optimized articles for ANY SaaS brand.
