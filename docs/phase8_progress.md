## 📊 Current Test Coverage

**Total Tests:** 46 tests (30 model + 16 controller)
**Pass Rate:** 100% (46/46 passing)
**Code Coverage:** 9.12% line coverage

**Coverage by Component:**
- Models: Partially covered (User, Project)
- Controllers: Partially covered (ProjectsController)
- Services: 0% (not tested yet)
- Jobs: 0% (not tested yet)
- Channels: 0% (not tested yet)

## ⏳ Remaining Work

### Still Need to Test:

1. **Model Tests (3 more models)**
   - Keyword model (scopes, helpers, enums)
   - Article model (status transitions, export methods)
   - KeywordResearch model (retry! method)

2. **Controller Tests (1 more controller)**
   - ArticlesController (create, show, export, destroy)

3. **Service Tests (high priority)**
   - PlansService (credits_for_plan, free_tier_credits)
   - KeywordMetricsService (heuristics, opportunity scoring)
   - Basic smoke tests for other services

4. **Job Tests (medium priority)**
   - KeywordResearchJob (status updates, error handling)
   - ArticleGenerationJob (status updates, cost tracking)

5. **Channel Tests (low priority)**
   - KeywordResearchChannel (authorization, broadcasting)
   - ArticleChannel (authorization, broadcasting)

## 🎯 Target Coverage

- **Phase 8 Goal:** 60% line coverage
- **Current:** 9.12%
- **Remaining:** 50.88% to go

**Estimated tests needed:**
- 15 more model tests (Keyword, Article, KeywordResearch)
- 12 more controller tests (ArticlesController)
- 20 service tests (PlansService, KeywordMetricsService, etc.)
- 10 job tests (KeywordResearchJob, ArticleGenerationJob)
- **Total:** ~57 more tests to reach 60% coverage

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete remaining model tests (Keyword, Article, KeywordResearch)
2. ✅ Add ArticlesController tests
3. ✅ Add critical service tests (PlansService, KeywordMetricsService)
4. ⏭ Add job tests (KeywordResearchJob, ArticleGenerationJob)
5. ⏭ Verify 60%+ coverage achieved

## 📈 Progress Summary

- ✅ Testing infrastructure setup complete
- ✅ 46 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ 9.12% coverage (baseline established)
- ⏳ 57 more tests needed for 60% coverage
- ⏳ Focus on high-value tests (services, critical paths)

**Est. Time Remaining:** 2-3 hours for 60% coverage
