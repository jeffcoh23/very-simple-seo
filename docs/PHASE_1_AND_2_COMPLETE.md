# Phase 1 & 2 Complete: Brand Integration + Sitemap Scraping

## What We Just Built

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Brand Integration (Complete)

**Problem:** Articles had no brand mentions, used example.com placeholder CTAs

**Solution:**
1. **ArticleOutlineService** - Adds brand context to outline planning
2. **ArticleWriterService** - Natural brand mentions in intro/sections/conclusion
3. **ArticleImprovementService Pass 6** - Verifies and fixes brand integration
4. **Real CTAs** - Pulls from `project.call_to_actions` instead of hardcoded placeholders

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ 9 SignalLab mentions in regenerated article
- ‚úÖ No example.com placeholders
- ‚úÖ Brand positioning throughout content

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Sitemap Scraping (Complete)

**Problem:** Internal links pointed to `/articles/123` (broken 404s), missed real site content

**Solution:**
1. **SitemapScraperService** - Discovers ALL pages on your actual site
2. **4 Fallback Strategies** - Works even without sitemap.xml
3. **InternalLinkSuggester** - Uses scraped data instead of database articles
4. **Database Migration** - Added `internal_content_index` JSONB column

**Fallback Strategies (in order):**
```
1. Try sitemap.xml          ‚Üê Most sites (70%)
2. Try sitemap_index.xml    ‚Üê Large sites with multiple sitemaps
3. Try robots.txt            ‚Üê Find sitemap location
4. Try common paths          ‚Üê /blog, /pricing, /features (30% fallback)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Discover blog posts from /blog index
```

**Results (SignalLab):**
- ‚úÖ Found sitemap.xml.gz successfully
- ‚úÖ Discovered 4 real pages (homepage, pricing, help)
- ‚úÖ Extracted titles, meta descriptions, headings
- ‚úÖ Now suggests REAL URLs instead of broken /articles/:id paths

## How Sitemap Scraping Handles "No Sitemap" Sites

### Common Scenario (30-40% of sites don't have sitemaps):

**Fallback Strategy #4: Common Paths**

```ruby
# We try these standard paths:
common_paths = [
  '/blog',          # Blog index
  '/articles',      # Article listing
  '/pricing',       # Pricing page
  '/features',      # Features page
  '/about',         # About page
  '/contact',       # Contact page
  '/guides',        # Guides section
  '/resources',     # Resources page
  '/docs',          # Documentation
  '/help',          # Help center
  '/support',       # Support page
  '/faq',           # FAQ page
  '/use-cases',     # Use cases
  '/solutions',     # Solutions page
  '/product'        # Product page
]
```

**Then we:**
1. Check if each path returns 200 OK
2. If /blog exists, scrape it for blog post links
3. Extract metadata from each discovered page
4. Store in `project.internal_content_index`

**Example Results (No Sitemap):**
```
Discovered via common paths:
- https://example.com/pricing         ‚úÖ
- https://example.com/features        ‚úÖ
- https://example.com/blog            ‚úÖ
- https://example.com/blog/post-1     ‚úÖ (discovered from /blog)
- https://example.com/blog/post-2     ‚úÖ
- https://example.com/about           ‚úÖ
- https://example.com/contact         ‚úÖ

Total: 7 pages discovered (no sitemap needed!)
```

---

## Data Extracted From Each Page

```json
{
  "url": "https://signallab.app/pricing",
  "title": "Pricing - Business Idea Validation Plans | SignalLab",
  "meta_description": "Choose the perfect plan for startup idea validation...",
  "headings": [
    "Free Plan",
    "Pro Plan",
    "Enterprise",
    "Frequently Asked Questions"
  ],
  "summary": "Start free, upgrade as you grow. SignalLab offers...",
  "scraped_at": "2025-10-18T19:03:03Z"
}
```

**This allows AI to:**
- Link to pricing when discussing costs/plans
- Link to features when explaining capabilities
- Link to blog posts on related topics
- Use real, current page titles/descriptions

## Before vs After Comparison

### BEFORE (Broken):
```
Internal Links Suggested by AI:
- [Validation Guide](/articles/123) ‚ùå 404 error
- [Customer Interviews](/articles/456) ‚ùå 404 error

Brand Integration:
- 0 mentions of SignalLab ‚ùå
- CTAs: [Try it free](https://example.com/signup) ‚ùå Placeholder

- [Pricing](https://signallab.app/pricing) ‚úÖ Real page
- [Help Center](https://signallab.app/help) ‚úÖ Real page
- (More links as site grows)

Brand Integration:
- 9 mentions of SignalLab ‚úÖ Natural
- CTAs: [Try SignalLab](https://signallab.app/...) ‚úÖ Real

SERP Data Usage:
- 91% utilized ‚úÖ (maintained)

## Known Issue: Empty CTA in ProjectForm

### Problem:
`ProjectForm.jsx` line 42 initializes with empty CTA:
```javascript
call_to_actions: project?.call_to_actions || [{ text: "", url: "" }]
```

This saves a blank CTA to the database, which causes issues.

### Impact:
- Blank CTA passed to outline/writer
- AI tries to use `{ text: "", url: "" }` (invalid)
- No CTA appears in article

### Fix Needed:
Filter out empty CTAs before save:

```javascript
// In handleSubmit or before sending to backend:
const cleanedCTAs = data.project.call_to_actions.filter(cta =>
  cta.text.trim() !== '' && cta.url.trim() !== ''
)

// Update data with cleaned CTAs
const projectData = {
  ...data.project,
  call_to_actions: cleanedCTAs.length > 0 ? cleanedCTAs : []
}
```

**Recommendation:** Don't initialize with empty CTA. Start with empty array:
```javascript
call_to_actions: project?.call_to_actions?.length > 0
  ? project.call_to_actions
  : []
```

---

## How to Use

### 1. Scrape Sitemap (One-time or Monthly)

```ruby
# In Rails console or script:
project = Project.find(25)
service = SitemapScraperService.new(project)
result = service.perform

# Check results:
result[:success]  # => true
result[:pages].size  # => 4
project.internal_content_index  # => { pages: [...], last_scraped: "..." }
```

### 2. Generate Articles (Automatic)

Articles now automatically use scraped content:

```ruby
# When generating articles, internal links are suggested from:
# - project.internal_content_index['pages'] (scraped sitemap)
# - Fallback: project.articles.completed (if no sitemap scraped)

article = Article.create(...)
service = ArticleGenerationService.new(article)
service.perform

# Article will have:
# - Real internal links to pricing, features, blog
# - 2-5 SignalLab brand mentions
# - Real CTAs from project.call_to_actions
```

### 3. Refresh Content (Optional)

```ruby
# Recommended: Monthly refresh to catch new blog posts
SitemapScraperService.new(project).perform
```

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 3: Semantic Link Matching (2 hours)

Currently: Random selection of internal links
Better: Semantic similarity matching

```ruby
# Use OpenAI embeddings to match:
# - Article topic ‚Üí Most relevant existing page
# - Example: Article about "pricing strategies" ‚Üí Link to /pricing
# - Example: Article about "AI features" ‚Üí Link to /features/ai-personas
```

### Phase 4: Auto-Scraping (30 min)

```ruby
# Add to project creation:
after_create :scrape_sitemap

# Add background job:
class SitemapRefreshJob
  def perform(project_id)
    project = Project.find(project_id)
    SitemapScraperService.new(project).perform
  end
end

# Schedule monthly:
# SitemapRefreshJob.set(wait: 1.month).perform_later(project.id)
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema:
```ruby
# projects table
add_column :projects, :internal_content_index, :jsonb, default: {}
add_index :projects, :internal_content_index, using: :gin

# Structure:
{
  "pages": [
    { "url": "...", "title": "...", "meta_description": "...", "headings": [...] }
  ],
  "last_scraped": "2025-10-18T19:03:03Z",
  "discovery_method": "sitemap.xml",
  "total_pages": 4
}
```

### Services Modified:
1. `SitemapScraperService` (NEW) - 350 lines
2. `InternalLinkSuggester` - Updated to use scraped data
3. `ArticleOutlineService` - Brand context added
4. `ArticleWriterService` - Brand integration prompts
5. `ArticleImprovementService` - Pass 6 brand verification
6. `ArticleGenerationService` - Pass project to all services
