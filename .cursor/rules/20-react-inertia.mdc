# React + Inertia

- Pages in `app/frontend/pages/**`, components in `app/frontend/components/**`, hooks in `app/frontend/lib/**`.
- Accessible UI: keyboard focus, ARIA where needed; test interactive states.
- Keep state local; derive server data from props; avoid global stores until necessary.
- Co-locate small components; extract only when reused.
