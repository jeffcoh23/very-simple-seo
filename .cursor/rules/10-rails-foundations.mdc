# Rails 8 Foundations

- Controllers thin; push logic to `app/services` and queries to `app/queries`.
- Jobs via Solid Queue; make jobs **idempotent**.
- Avoid N+1; use `includes` judiciously; select columns; add scopes.
- Strong params only; never `.permit!`.
- Migrations: safe operations; backfill in batches; mind lock time.
