# Guardrails (apply to all changes)

- **Always write/update tests** when behavior changes or a bug is fixed.
- Keep diffs small; separate refactors from behavior changes.
- Document risks and acceptance checks in the PR body.
- Never log secrets; avoid printing tokens/keys.
- For public endpoints, apply rack-attack and explicit authorization.

**Done means**: code compiles, tests pass, lint/build ok, PR summary written.
