   - Analyzing permission and role management usability
   - Studying team size impact on feature usage
   - Investigating sharing and collaboration patterns
   - Researching admin burden and delegation needs
   - Analyzing team billing and payment workflows

**SaaS-Specific Research Methods**:
```javascript
// Cohort analysis for retention research
const analyzeCohortRetention = (users, timeframe) => {
  return users
    .groupBy('signup_month')
    .map(cohort => ({
      month: cohort.key,
      retention: calculateRetentionRates(cohort, timeframe)
    }))
}

// Feature adoption tracking
const trackFeatureAdoption = (feature, userSegment) => {
  return {
    discovery_rate: usersWhoFoundFeature / totalUsers,
    adoption_rate: usersWhoUsedFeature / usersWhoFoundFeature,
    retention_impact: compareRetention(adopters, nonAdopters)
  }
}
```

**SaaS User Journey Framework**:
```
Awareness → Trial Signup → Onboarding → Activation → 
Feature Adoption → Value Realization → Subscription → 
Expansion → Advocacy → Renewal
```

**Key SaaS Metrics to Research**:
- **Activation Rate**: Users who reach initial value
- **Trial-to-Paid**: Conversion rate from trial to subscription
- **Time-to-Value**: How quickly users achieve first success
- **Feature Adoption**: Which features drive retention
- **Monthly Churn Rate**: Subscription cancellation rate
- **Net Revenue Retention**: Expansion vs. churn revenue
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Long-term user value
- **Product-Market Fit Score**: User disappointment if product disappeared

**SaaS User Research Personas**:
```
The Evaluator (Trial User):
- Goals: Assess product fit for their needs
- Pain Points: Limited time, comparing options
- Key Moments: First value achievement, feature discovery
- Research Focus: Onboarding flow, trial limitations

The Administrator (Account Owner):
- Goals: Manage team, control costs, ensure adoption
- Pain Points: User adoption, billing complexity
- Key Moments: Team setup, permission management
- Research Focus: Admin experience, reporting needs

The End User (Daily User):
- Goals: Accomplish daily tasks efficiently
- Pain Points: Feature discoverability, workflow integration
- Key Moments: Task completion, collaboration

```

**Churn Prediction Research Framework**:
```javascript
// Early warning indicators to research
const churnRiskFactors = {
  usage_decline: 'Decreased activity in last 14 days',
  feature_abandonment: 'Stopped using key features',
  support_escalation: 'Multiple support tickets',
  team_reduction: 'Removed team members',
  billing_issues: 'Payment failures or downgrades',
  login_frequency: 'Reduced login frequency'
}

// Exit interview questions
const exitInterviewQuestions = [
  "What initially led you to try our product?",
  "What value did you hope to achieve?",
  "What prevented you from achieving that value?",
  "What would need to change for you to reconsider?",
  "How did our product compare to alternatives?"
]
```

**Conversion Rate Optimization Research**:
```
Landing Page → Trial Signup → Account Setup → 
Initial Use → Value Achievement → Billing Setup → Active Subscription

Research Questions by Stage:
- Landing: Does messaging match user intent?
- Signup: Is trial signup too complex?
- Setup: Can users configure successfully?
- Initial Use: Do users achieve quick wins?
- Value: Do users understand the value?
- Billing: Is payment process smooth?
```

Hypothesis: Simplifying the trial signup flow will increase 
conversion by reducing cognitive load

Test: Compare 3-step vs 1-step signup
Metric: Trial signup completion rate
Secondary: Trial-to-paid conversion rate
