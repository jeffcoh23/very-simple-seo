      retention_date = start_date + months_later.months
      retained_count = customers.joins(:subscriptions)
                               .where(subscriptions: { status: 'active' })
                               .where('subscriptions.created_at <= ?', retention_date.end_of_month)
                               .count
      
      {
        month: months_later,
