## Post Templates by Subreddit

### r/entrepreneur Posts

**Template 1: Validation Reality Check**
```
Title: "I've validated 200+ startup ideas - here are the red flags that predict failure"

Post:
After validating hundreds of business ideas, I've noticed patterns that predict success vs failure with scary accuracy.

üö© RED FLAGS (90% fail rate):
- "It's like Uber for X"
- Solving problems only entrepreneurs have
- Requiring massive behavior change
- "We have no competition" (biggest lie)

‚úÖ GREEN FLAGS (70% success rate):
- Customers already pay for terrible solutions
- Clear pain that costs real money/time
- Simple to explain to your grandma
- Existing market with frustrated users

The brutal truth? Most ideas fail because founders skip validation or do it wrong.

I built an AI tool that simulates customer conversations because I was tired of seeing good people waste years on bad ideas.

Want me to validate your idea? Drop it below and I'll give you the unfiltered truth (yes, it might hurt).

Edit: Wow, lots of responses. I'll get through as many as I can today.
```

**Template 2: Controversial Take**
```
Title: "Unpopular opinion: Customer interviews are worse than useless"

Post:
Controversial take: Traditional customer interviews are killing more startups than they're helping.

Here's why:
1. People lie in interviews (unconsciously)
2. They tell you what they think you want to hear
3. What people SAY they'll do ‚â† what they'll actually do
4. Confirmation bias makes you hear what you want

I've seen founders waste months interviewing "potential customers" who gave glowing feedback, then launch to crickets.

The solution? Stop asking what people will do. Start observing what they actually do.

Better validation methods:
- Build a simple landing page and measure signups
- Create a waitlist and see who actually joins
- Simulate the buying decision with AI personas
- Pre-sell before you build anything

I switched to AI-powered validation after watching too many founders get burned by "positive" customer interviews.

Roast me in the comments if you disagree üî•

### r/startups Posts

**Template 1: Failure Analysis**
```
Title: "Analyzed 100 startup failures - 80% made this same validation mistake"

Post:
Just finished analyzing 100 failed startups from the past 2 years. The pattern is depressing but predictable.

80% failed because they built something nobody wanted.
But here's the kicker - most of them DID validate their idea first.

So what went wrong?

The validation methods were garbage:
‚ùå Asked friends and family (they lie)
‚ùå Posted in Facebook groups (selection bias)
‚ùå Surveyed people who weren't paying customers
‚ùå Built based on their own assumptions

The 20% that succeeded did this instead:
‚úÖ Found people already paying for solutions
‚úÖ Identified expensive, painful problems
‚úÖ Validated willingness to pay BEFORE building
‚úÖ Talked to people who'd actually buy, not just use

Most painful example: A founder spent 18 months building a "revolutionary" project management tool. Got great feedback from 50+ interviews.

Launch day: 3 signups.

The problem? He interviewed people who weren't decision-makers. The actual buyers (CTOs) had completely different priorities.

This is why I built an AI validation tool - to simulate conversations with actual buyer personas, not just anyone willing to give feedback.

What validation mistakes have you seen (or made)?

### r/SideProject Posts

**Template 1: Tool Showcase**
```
Title: "Built an AI that roasts business ideas (it's brutally honest)"

Post:
Got tired of seeing friends waste years on bad startup ideas, so I built something to help.

AI Validator (https://ai-validator.fly.dev) - it creates customer personas and simulates conversations to validate business ideas.

The AI doesn't sugarcoat feedback. It'll tell you if your idea sucks and why.

Example roast: "Your 'social network for dog owners' idea assumes people want another social app. They don't. Dog owners already use Facebook groups and Instagram. Your differentiator isn't compelling enough to overcome switching costs."

Harsh? Yes. Accurate? Usually.

Been testing it with 50+ entrepreneurs. The ones who listened to the harsh feedback pivoted and are doing better. The ones who ignored it... well, let's just say the AI was right.

Try it out and let me know what you think. Fair warning: it might hurt your feelings, but it'll save you months of wasted effort.

What's the harshest feedback you've gotten on a project idea?

## Engagement Amplification Tactics

### Comment Strategy
When your post gets traction:
1. **Respond to every comment within 2 hours**
2. **Ask follow-up questions to extend conversations**
3. **Share additional insights in comments**
4. **Offer free validation to engaged users**
5. **Create controversy with thoughtful disagreement**

### Cross-Promotion
When a post does well:
1. **Screenshot and share on Twitter**
2. **Create follow-up posts in other subreddits**
3. **Turn insights into blog content**
4. **Build email list from engaged commenters**

Your goal is to create Reddit content that gets massive engagement while positioning you as the go-to expert for startup validation. Every post should provide genuine value while naturally demonstrating why AI Validator is the future of business validation.
