  // Usage metrics (40% of score)
  const usageScore = calculateUsageHealth(customer);
  score += usageScore * 0.4;

  const adoptionScore = calculateFeatureAdoption(customer);
  score += adoptionScore * 0.25;
  
  // Engagement metrics (20% of score)
  const engagementScore = calculateEngagement(customer);
  score += engagementScore * 0.2;
  
  // Support interactions (15% of score)
  const supportScore = calculateSupportHealth(customer);
  score += supportScore * 0.15;
  
  return Math.round(score);
};

const healthCategories = {
  90-100: 'Champion', // Expansion opportunity
  70-89: 'Healthy',   // Maintain current success
  50-69: 'At Risk',   // Proactive intervention needed
  0-49: 'Critical'    // Immediate attention required
};
```

**Rails Customer Success Implementation**:
```ruby

    # Feature adoption (core features used)
    adoption_health = calculate_adoption_health(customer)  
    score += adoption_health * 0.25
    
    # Engagement (support interactions, NPS, feedback)
    engagement_health = calculate_engagement_health(customer)
    score += engagement_health * 0.2
    
    # Account growth (team size, usage limits)
    growth_health = calculate_growth_health(customer)
    score += growth_health * 0.15
